// Note: ideally our app will have a module just for the model/networking layer. The initializer should be internal,
// which means a DayForecast would be initialized just by the networking layer. It also means that this data structure
// will not be modified anywhere. This improve separation of responsibilities and safety in the codebase
// Note2: ideally we would like to have an enum with all the possible condition codes. So we would match the condition to the right case
// when the response is parsed. Then the icon would be a getter property of the enum case.
